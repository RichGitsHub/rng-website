    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <em>WHEELS</em> is a narrative screenplay drawn from the rise and fall of
          Roller Hockey International — a league fueled by ambition, money,
          near-misses, and the belief that the next break was always one shift away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The story follows players, promoters, and dreamers caught between sport
          and spectacle, loyalty and opportunity, and the cost of chasing something
          just out of reach.

      <h2>A note on the work</h2>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          A couple of years ago, I made the difficult decision to put my <em>WHEELS</em>
          screenplay on the back burner. I had spent three years working on it, on and off,
          and while there’s strong material in it, much of it was written in the wrong format.
          It leaned toward a director’s script — and directors don’t tend to welcome direction,
          especially from a novice screenwriter.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve since returned to the project with a clearer sense of the form and the discipline
          it demands. I’m actively working on <em>WHEELS</em> again now, and I expect to have a
          sharp, finished script before too much longer.

<span class="character">COACH BOBBY HULL, JR.</span>
<span class="dialogue">
There are hundreds of guys trying out today. If you’re not selected by the Los Angeles
Landsharks, it’s not a slam on you. Most of the team has already been picked, between
players already on the team, and those selected in the draft. If any of you make it,
you should be proud.
</span>

<span class="character">PLAYER WEARING ROLLERBLADES</span>
<span class="dialogue">
That doesn’t sound too promising.
</span>

<span class="character">COACH BOBBY HULL, JR.</span>
<span class="dialogue">
If you can’t score, hit somebody. If you can’t hit somebody, score!
</span>

<span class="character">ASSISTANT COACH</span>
<span class="dialogue">
And if you can’t do either, coach.

I heard that.

OK, first line of red jerseys scrimmage against first line of blue jerseys. Go!
</span>

<span class="character">COACH BOBBY HULL, JR.</span>
<span class="dialogue">
Good thing our team is already mostly set. Some of these guys are delusional if they
think they’re pro caliber.

<span class="character">ASSISTANT COACH</span>
<span class="dialogue">
Got that right. Look at Bambi over there.
</span>

<span class="character">COACH BOBBY HULL, JR.</span>
<span class="dialogue">
There’s one guy I’ve got my eye on for a forward. See that kid over there? He’s making
some impressive passes and scoring some skillful goals. Holy crap! He’s in a fight!
And he’s holding his own.
</span>

<span class="character">ASSISTANT COACH</span>
<span class="dialogue">
I’d say. The other guy is big, but he’s turtling. He’s done.
